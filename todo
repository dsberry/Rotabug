Bugs:

- On fresh load, click "test1" or "test2" button threee times. The "TE TE" message from the server is displayed twice, rather than once.
  Looking in ~/rotabug/php.log shows that two requests were sent from the client on the third click.
  The error happens when the "test1" button in the test2 view is clicked for the second time.
  SOLVED - Each time a view was presented by calling the "go" method in the presenter, the bind() method would be called again, 
  adding another click listener to the biutton. SOLUTION - only bind once for each display.
  

Current Work:

- 20/10/12: Rationalise the use of presenters, views and event types. Try to gather all "case"-like 
  statements together into one place. Move as much as the work as possible out of specific subclasses, 
  into the base class Presenter, View and RotabugEvent. Done. See "How to".
  
-  As a means of getting back into all this after a long gap, could go through and comment everything properly?
