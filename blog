Domain name:
------------

On 4/9/2012 at 17:09 BST I registered the domain name www.rotabug.com
using my justhost account (chorleyandleylandmethodists.org "I am not a
spade" https://my.justhost.com/cgi-bin/cplogin). It is free for one year,
and they will automatically re-register it each year, I assume at the
cost of £7.99 that was shown on the registration age.



To begin a new blank project:
----------------------------

- install eclipse (https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/usingeclipse)
- install GWT plugin for eclipse
- create a web application
  - Rotabug in package com.rotabug
  - do generate sample code
  - "Create project in " -> /var/www/html (see
    http://cambiatablog.wordpress.com/2010/11/22/gwt-developing-with-hosted-mode-and-phpxampp/ )
  - delete GreetingService*.java from src/com.rotabug.client
  - delete FieldVerified.java from src/com.rotabug.shared
  - delete all content from onModuleLoad in Rotabug.java
  - delete all unused stuff from Rotabug.java

  - Edit Rotabug.html within "war"
    - Remove comments
    - Change title to "Rotabug - rota creation made easy"
    - Delete all body elements other than the history enabling iframe and <noscript> tag.
    - Add a line "<div id="Rotabug"></div>" at the top of the body.


- Right click on "war" and click on "New" then "Other", then "PHP" then "PHP File" - enter name "Rotabug.php" and finish.
- Right click on "war" and click on "New" then "Other", then "PHP" then "PHP File" - enter name "rb.php" and finish.
- Copy ~/Downloads/rb.php /var/www/html/Rotabug/war (to replace the file created above -
see redbeanphp.com)

- Right click the eclipse project name in the package explorer ("Rotabug") and look for
  the Run As > Run Configurations… alternative. In the dialog box, sele the "Web
  Application" - "Rotabug" item in the left tree, and open the Arguments tab. Set the
  startupurl string to http://localhost/Rotabug/war/Rotabug.html . Then click "Run" at
  bottom of dialog box.

- DO the same again but this time select "Debug As" > "Debug Configurations"� alternative.
- In eclipse, click the "GWT Compile PRoject" item in the "Google" button

- Click the green "Run" button, then double click the url that appears (should be http://localhost/Rotabug/war/Rotabug.html?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997)



To test a change:
-----------------

- In eclipse, save all changes (contrl-S) and compile the project ("GWT
            Compile Project" in the google button)
- If development mode is not already running, click the green "Run" button,
  then double click the url that appears (should be
  http://localhost/Rotabug/war/Rotabug.html?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997)
- If development mode is already running, click the yellow back-to-back
  arrows symbol, and reload the web page in the browser.




MVP etc
-------

See https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/articles/mvp-architecture

For each form/GUI seen by the user that is part of the app we need:

1) Give it a name: e.g.  "Home", "Login", "EditVenue", etc

2) A presenter class: e.g "HomePresenter", "LoginPresenter", etc. It
includes a definition of a "Display" interface that defines all the
interatactions between the presenter and the view (and a method to get
the view as a single Widget). .


3) A view class: e.g. "HomeView", "LoginView", etc. This contains just the
widgets themselves with no event handlers or other logic.





4) EntryPoint.onModuleLoad: Creates any app-wide resources (used by
multiple views/presenters). E.g. the server and user requesters, the
AppController, the EventBus. It then passes control to the AppController.


5) Define a set of app wide event classes - these are events that a
presenter fires that are acted upon by other presenters. Each class needs
to extend GwtEvent., and requires an associated event handler class.

PHP:

1) install PDT (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/PDT/Installation#Eclipse_3.7_.2F_Indigo_.2F_PDT_3.0)
2) Check php server is running by creating /var/www/html/index.php holding

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

and then visiting http://localhost/index.php

3) The rotabug.php file writes to a log file so make sure it exists:

% touch /home/dsb/rotabug/php.log
% chmod a+w /home/dsb/rotabug/php.log

4) Make sure phpmyadmin is installed (e.g. see help.ubuntu.com/community/phpMyAdmin)
5) sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
6) Go to  http://localhost/phpmyadmin  in a browser, log in as root.
7) Click "databases" and create a new database called rotabug
